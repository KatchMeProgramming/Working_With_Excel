Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
When you look at campaigns by category, the most successful categorires include the "arts" as ranked (theater, film & video and music).  A little more than half (57%) of all campaigns run are successful across these top 3 categories.
Plays are the most successful campaigns by sub-category.  Also, about half (54%) of the campaigns for plays are successful.
Campaigns are more successful in the early summer months, June and July, across all categories. For theater campaigns, they are more successful in June and July as well as early fall (September and October).

What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesnâ€™t provide context on whether a campaign is a new campaign or a rerun of a campaign from past years. 
The dataset also doesn't provde context the target audience. For example, what were the age groups of the backers, etc.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
You can look at the success of the campaign by duration of the campaign.  This will show you if longer campaigns are more successful.  You could do a bar graph that shows duration vs. success rate.
You can also look at the average donation by category or sub-category of the campaign. This can be a table that informs future goals for the number of backers required to hit campaign goals.
